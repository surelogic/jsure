This package's purpose is to
create and load game data files.  A <code>saveWorld</code> method creates a game data
from a given game world instance.  A <code>loadWorld</code> method loads a game data
file from disk and creates a new game world instance from it.  This package
also contains the &quot;DefaultWorld.xml&quot; game data file, which can be loaded
using the <code>loadDefaultWorld</code> method.
