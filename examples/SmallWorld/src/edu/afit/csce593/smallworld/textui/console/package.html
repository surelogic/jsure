This package contains the textual
user interface for SmallWorld.  This is a very simple user interface that
reads and writes to the computer console (like a DOS window).  The main
program (that you can run) in this package is the <code>SmallWorld</code> class.
Currently SmallWorld has two user interfaces,
one textual and one (just barely) graphical.
