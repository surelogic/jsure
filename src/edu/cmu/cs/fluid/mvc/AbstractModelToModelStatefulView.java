/**
 * Default implementation of a StatefulView for use when attributes from
 * multiple source models do not need to be merged when presented to views of
 * the stateful view. Implements the methods to delegate to the provided core
 * implementations.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <em>It is the subclasser's responsibility to initialize
 * the model-level attribute {@link View#SRC_MODELS}.</em>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This class implements the infrastructure for rebuilding a stateful view. The
 * infrastructure is similar to that used by the AWT: a rebuild may be
 * scheduled to occur, and when it does occur, it executes on a different
 * thread. Every stateful view has it's own rebuild thread, of class
 * {@link AbstractModelToModelStatefulView.RebuildWorkerThread}. The thread
 * waits for a rebuild request that is triggered by a call to
 * {@link #signalBreak}. The method <code>signalBreak</code> appends the
 * provided ModelEvent to the end of a list (referred to by {@link #events})
 * and schedules the rebuild thread to wake up.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The call to <code>signalBreak</code> can originate from a subclass (e.g.,
 * the stateful view has been altered directly) or as a result of receiving an
 * event from a source model. In the later case, the call is placed by instance
 * of {@link AbstractModelToModelStatefulView.BreakageListener}referred to by
 * the instance file {@link #srcModelBreakageHandler}. This listener should be
 * registered with every independent source model of the stateful view. The
 * breakage listener handles {@link RebuildEvent}s specially. They are not
 * passed to <code>signalBreak</code>}. They are instead used to toggle the
 * state of a {@link AbstractModelToModelStatefulView.SrcBuildState}object,
 * which keeps track of which source models are in the process of rebuildling
 * themselves. The <code>SrcBuildState</code> instance is shared among the
 * stateful view, the rebuild thread, and the breakage listener, and his
 * referenced by the fields {@link #srcState},
 * {@link AbstractModelToModelStatefulView.RebuildWorkerThread#srcState}, and
 * {@link AbstractModelToModelStatefulView.BreakageListener#srcState}
 * respectively.
 * 
 * <p>
 * As mentioned already, the rebuild thread waits for notification that an
 * event has been received. A {@link RebuildEvent}is fired indicating that a
 * rebuild has begun. At this point it then waits for its source models to be
 * quiescent; that is, none of them to be updating their state. It uses
 * {@link AbstractModelToModelStatefulView.SrcBuildState#waitForQuiescence}for
 * this purpose. Once this is true, it appends the received events to a local
 * list (initially empty) and passes that list to the abstract method
 * {@link #rebuildModel(List)}. Subclasses implement this to rebuild
 * themselves. If the state of the stateful view is actually changed, the
 * implementation must result in the firing of at least one {@link ModelEvent}
 * so that views of this model are informed of its breakage. Upon successful
 * completion of <code>rebuildModel</code>, a <code>RebuildEvent</code> is
 * fired indicating that the stateful view has completed a rebuild.
 * 
 * <p>
 * There is one further subtlety. If a non- <code>RebuildEvent</code> arrives
 * while a local rebuild is in process, then the rebuild thread is interrupted.
 * Implemenations of {@link #rebuildModel(List)}should check the interrupted
 * status of the current thread (it always runs in the rebuild thread) and
 * throw an {@link java.lang.InterruptedException}if the thread has been
 * interrupted. This is caught within the rebuild thread's body and triggers
 * the local rebuild process to start over. Even if {@link #rebuildModel(List)}
 * does not check for interruptions, the rebuild will be done over if an event
 * was received during the rebuild. Checking for interruptions prevents wasted
 * work, however.
