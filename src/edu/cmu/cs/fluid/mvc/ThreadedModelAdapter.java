 * Wrapper of {@link ModelListener}s that insures the wrapped listener is

 * <li>Executed in a thread distinct from the thread that sent the event it is
 * responded to
 * <li>Executed in a context in which no locks are held
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Each adapter has its own thread, which is used over the lifetime of the
 * adapter. The thread is a {@link Thread#setDaemon(boolean) daemon thread} and
 * thus its existence will not prevent the shutdown of the system.
 * 
 * <p>Each <code>ThreadedModelAdapter</code> has a single thread associated with
 * it in which the delegated model listener's {@link #breakView(ModelEvent)}
 * method is executed.  The delegate's {@link #addedToModel(Model)} and
 * {@link #removedFromModel(Model)} methods are left to execute in whatever
 * thread they were called from.
 * 
 * <p>A single instance of <code>ThreadedModelAdapter</code> may be registered
 * as a listener with many models.  <em>The thread associated with the
 * <code>ThreadedModelAdapter</code> will be stopped as soon as the adapter is
 * no longer registered with any models.</em>  The thread does not start
 * execution until the adapter is registered with its first model.
