/**
 * Wrapper of {@link ModelListener}s that insures the wrapped listeners are
 * <ul>
 * <li>Executed in a thread distinct from the thread that sent the event it is
 * responding to
 * <li>Executed in a context in which no locks are held
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>The intent behind this thread is that multiple model listeners for a 
 * single model can <em>share</em> a single thread.  It is a misuse of this
 * class to register an instance as a listener with two different models, and
 * an exception will be thrown if this done.  This class is used by first
 * {@link #SharedThreadModelAdapter(Model) creating a new instance}.  The 
 * adapter can then be added as a listener to the model it was previously
 * associated with.  The <code>ModelListener</code> object can be 
 * {@link #addModelListener(ModelListener) registered with the adapter}.
 * 
 * <p>If the adapter is registered as a listener with a model that is not the
 * model it was initialized with, then the {@link SharedThreadModelAdapter#addedToModel(Model)}
 * method will throw an <code>IllegalArgumentException</code>.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The created threads are all {@link java.lang.Thread#setDaemon(boolean) daemon}
 * threads.  The thread is stopped when the adapter is removed from the model
 * it is attached to.
