/**
 * Absurdly complicated to make sure that IJavaFlowAnalysis objects are obtained
 * lazily.  We need to do this otherwise analyses will be kicked of as soon as
 * a query is created.  This is not desirable because sometimes queries aren't 
 * used.  They are sometimes created ahead of time just in case they might
 * be needed because it isn't always possible to create the query when it is
 * needed due to loss of contextual information.  So a query doesn't force its
 * underlying analysis object to exist until someone calls {@link #getResultFor(IRNode)}
 * on the query.
 * 
 * <p>Four cases:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Unevaluated analysis object
 *   <li>Unevaluated subanalysis derived from an unevaluated analysis 
 *   <li>Evaluated analysis object
 *   <li>Bottom-returning
 * </ol>
 * 
 * <p>Can be initialized in any one of three states.

  /*
   * A recurring issue when getting a subanalysis object is whether we need to
   * create a specialized "bottom-returning" query. This happens when the
   * getSubanalysis() method from the SubANalysisFactory returns null. In this
   * case, we assume the subanalysis was not created because the code that
   * contains it is dead: it is in an "if (false) { ... }" statement, for
   * example. So the user can query about this code, but the control flow
   * analysis never visits it. We want to return a query that always returns
   * BOTTOM.
   * 
   * Every time we need to generate a subanalysis object we have to take the
   * above into account. Unfortunately this happens in three different places
   * that return three different type of objects: queries, delegates, and
   * analyses, respectively. It is very important all three locations get
   * updated appropriately when this class is changed.
   * 
   * A problem with the bottom-returning approach is that I cannot determine if
   * the caller of this method is just plain confused and shouldn't be asking me
   * about the subanalysis for the given "caller". Could check for this by
   * checking that caller is a descendant of the flow unit node associated with
   * the current analysis and that no instance initializer blocks come between
   * them, but that is expensive.
