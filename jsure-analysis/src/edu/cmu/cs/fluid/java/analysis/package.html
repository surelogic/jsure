<BODY>
<p> This package includes classes for performing control-flow analysis
of Java programs.  It uses the generic control-flow analysis in
package {@link edu.cmu.cs.fluid.control},
{@link edu.cmu.cs.fluid.control.ForwardAnalysis} and 
{@link edu.cmu.cs.fluid.control.BackwardAnalysis}.
These analyses need to be parameterized by <em>transfer functions</em>
that give the rules for each kind of language-specific node in the
control-flow graph. The transfer functions in the interfaces
{@link edu.cmu.cs.fluid.control.ForwardTransfer} and
{@link edu.cmu.cs.fluid.control.BackwardTransfer} are generic in name.
The (abstract) classes {@link edu.cmu.cs.fluid.java.analysis.JavaForwardTransfer}
and {@link edu.cmu.cs.fluid.java.analysis.JavaBackwardTransfer} implement them with a large
set of Java-specific transfer methods with Java-specific names such as
<tt>transferAssignment</tt>.  Part of the work of transfer classes is
dealing with labels; a local helper class {@link edu.cmu.cs.fluid.java.analysis.LabelMatch}
does much of the messy work.  The class
{@link edu.cmu.cs.fluid.java.analysis.IntraproceduralAnalysis} provides a template for
control-flow analyses which work on one method at a time.
It keeps a cache of recently requested analyses in LRU order.
Aside from a test analysis that does nothing interesting, we also
have {@link edu.cmu.cs.fluid.java.analysis.LiveVariables}, and
{@link edu.cmu.cs.fluid.java.analysis.PredicateAnalysis}.
For now, we also have some other analyses, but they are likely to be
removed, or merged into other analyses.
</p>

<p> This package also includes other analyses, ones that do not
operate on the control-flow graph.  For instance,
{@link edu.cmu.cs.fluid.java.analysis.EffectsAnalysis} computes the effects of statements and
expressions. </p>

<p> All the analyses need to use binding information, and some need to
use other analyses to work.  The binding information depends on the
configuration and since we want to handle multiple configurations, the
current binding is an instance, not static.  Thus we keep track of a
set of analyses together in an instance of
{@link edu.cmu.cs.fluid.java.analysis.AnalysisContext}.</p>
