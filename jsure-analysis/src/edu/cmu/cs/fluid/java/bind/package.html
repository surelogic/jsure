<BODY>
The Fluid Java language infrastructure.
<h1>Requirements</h1>
<ul>
<li> Loader 
     <br> Parses and loads files into a Universe
     <br> Ability to load files into the system on demand (or not)
     <br> Ability to scan for dependencies and load those files

<li> Universe
     <br> Keeps track of all files loaded into the system.
     <br> Handles persistence of pre-loaded IR (load/save) 

<li> TypeEnvironment 
     <br> Keeps track of all types mapped for a particular system
     <br> Support different TypeEnvironments for different systems

<li> Binder 
     <br> Computes both the bindings and types (the latter for expressions)
     <br> Cannot cause any events that would create a new Version.
</ul>

<h2>Possible Future Requirements</h2>
Support for multiple ClassLoaders (i.e. diff simultaneous TypeEnvironments)

<h1>External interfaces</h1>
    <h2>Loader</h2>
    <h2>Universe</h2>
    <h2>TypeEnvironment</h2>
    <h2>Binder</h2>
    	<h3>getBinding</h3>
	This can be called to get the binding for the following kinds of names:
	<ul>
	<li> NamedType
	<li> ArrayType
	<li> VoidType
	<li> PrimitiveType
	<li> ThisE, SuperE (if precomputed)
	<li> UseE
	<li> FieldRef
	<li> Call {MethodCall, NewE, AnonClassE, ConstructorCall)
	<li> RegionName
	</ul>
	Note: this currently has the problem that it will go into an infinite
	loop if one tries to get the binding on a node that is not supported.
	(FIX throw SlotUndefinedException if not one of the above)

	<h3>getType</h3>
	Types are kept unique by the Universe/TypeEnvironment, so as to be able
	to use IRNode.identity() to do comparisons (FIX code?), and are
	represented as follows:
	<ul>
	<li>IRNode(VoidType) for the void return type
	<li>IRNode(PrimitiveType) for primitive types
	<li>IRNode(TypeDeclInterface) for [anon, nested] classes and interfaces
	<li>IRNode(ArrayDeclaration) for arrays (indexed by base, dims)
	<li>IRNode(TypeDeclaration) for the "null" type
	</ul>

	<h3>getValue</h3>
	As yet unimplemented.

	<h3>getRegionParent</h3>
	To be implemented RSN.

<h1>Distribution of functionality among the different classes</h1>

<h2>{@link edu.cmu.cs.fluid.java.bind.ITypeEnvironment}</h2>
Contains mappings from qualified names to types in the Universe

    <h3>{@link edu.cmu.cs.fluid.java.bind.AbstractTypeEnvironment}</h3>

<h2>{@link edu.cmu.cs.fluid.java.bind.IBinder}</h2>
The external interface to the binding infrastructure, creating the illusion that
there are separate SlotInfos for bindings, types, and values.

	<h3>{@link edu.cmu.cs.fluid.java.bind.IBindHelper}</h3>
    A helper class that uses a LocalEnvironment to resolve simple names within a TypeEnvironment.    

    <h3>{@link edu.cmu.cs.fluid.java.bind.LocalEnvironment}</h3>
    Embodies the imports (both explicit and implicit) for a CompilationUnit.
    <br>
    Simple names are resolved in this order:
    <ol>
    <li>Declared in same CU
    <li>Specifically imported
    <li>Part of the same package
    <li>Part of "java.lang"
    <li>Part of an imported package
    </ol>
    
<h2>{@link edu.cmu.cs.fluid.java.bind.IBindHelper}</h2>


<h2>{@link edu.cmu.cs.fluid.java.bind.ILoaderTest}</h2>
A helper class to abstract the use of the Loader, Binder and TypeEnvironment from test code.

<h2>{@link edu.cmu.cs.fluid.java.bind.PromiseConstants}</h2>
Definitions of the globally defined regions
