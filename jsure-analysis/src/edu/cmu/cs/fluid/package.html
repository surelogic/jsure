<BODY>
<p> This package and its subpackages contains the executable classes
making up the current implementation of the ACT/Fluid prototype.  This
package in particular contains very little, just a few exception
classes.  To learn more about the basic internal representation see
{@link edu.cmu.cs.fluid.ir}, {@link edu.cmu.cs.fluid.tree}, and
{@link edu.cmu.cs.fluid.version}.  Generic parsing and unparsing
classes live in the {@link edu.cmu.cs.fluid.parse} and
{@link edu.cmu.cs.fluid.unparse} packages respectively. The package
{@link edu.cmu.cs.fluid.control} contains classes for control-flow
graphs and analysis over them.  <!--The package
edu.cmu.cs.fluid.test and its subpackages demonstrates some of
the generic capabilities in the context of a trivial language.-->
The package {@link edu.cmu.cs.fluid.java} implements the capabilities
for the Java programming language.  The package
{@link edu.cmu.cs.fluid.display} contains basic user-interface
classes.</p>
