<P>This package contains the basic components for implementing
models and views.  

<P>A model is a data structure made up of IR structure.  All
models have a set of highlighters associated with them.  A
highlighter is a set of nodes along with a role, that describes
the set. 

<P>A view is a thing that presents a model.  It has the ability
to hide nodes that make up the model.

<P>All basic kinds of views and models should be declared as
interfaces.  These interfaces are used when declaring the 
types of variables and parameters.  The interfaces form a hierarchy
distinct from the implementation of a model or view.  There are three
generic interfaces:
<DL>
<DT>{@link edu.cmu.cs.fluid.mvc.Model}
<DD>The root interface for all models.  Defines the basic
    operations that can be performed on any model.

<DT>{@link edu.cmu.cs.fluid.mvc.View}
<DD>The root interface for all views.  Defines the basic 
    operations that can be performed on any view.

<DT>{@link edu.cmu.cs.fluid.mvc.ModelToModelStatefulView}
<DD>The root interface for views that are also views.
</DL>


<P>Every model interface must inherit from {@link edu.cmu.cs.fluid.mvc.Model},
every view interface must inherit from {@link edu.cmu.cs.fluid.mvc.View}, and
every stateful view interface must inherit from
{@link edu.cmu.cs.fluid.mvc.ModelToModelStatefulView}, and the appropriate view and model
interfaces.

<p>[Insert fancy figure here.]

<P>Every non-empty model and view interface has a core class 
implementation.  The core class provides generic implementations
for as many of the <em>non-inherited</em> methods (that is only the
new methods added in <code>FooModel</code>, and not those inherited
from <code>Model</code>) defined in the interface as possible.   A core
class must not be <code>abstract</code>.  Core class objects are instantiated
and delegated to from within model/stateful-view impementations.
Because it must not be abstract, core classes do not declare
that they implement any particular interface.

<P>A concrete implemenation of a pure model must implement the 
appropriate model interface.  It need not extend any class, although
it may be convienent to extend a particular partially implemented abstract class.
Concrete implementations must be package private in scope, and instances of 
them are generated using public factory classes.  The convention is for the
interface of an instantiatable model to contain a <code>Factory</code> 
nested interface.  Most factory classes use singleton prototype instances.
