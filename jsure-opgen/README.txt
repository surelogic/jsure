To create opgen.jar:
-- Right-click on META-INF/MANIFEST.MF and select "PDE Tools | Create Ant Build File"
-- Right-click on the resulting build.xml and select "Run As | Ant Build" (first)
   You may need to refresh the project before you can see opgen.jar
 
   For the future, you probably want to change the Eclipse settings for the Ant
   build under "External Tools".  There should be a "Refresh" tab, where you can
   set it to automatically refresh the project when you run the Ant build.
