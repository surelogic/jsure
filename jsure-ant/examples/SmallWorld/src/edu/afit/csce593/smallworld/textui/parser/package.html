This package contains the logic to &quot;parse&quot; or understand what
the user types into the game.  Since both the
text and graphical user interfaces take strings of text from the user as
input to the game, this package captures the common parsing code used by
both user interfaces.  For example, when the user enters the letters
&quot;move south&quot; the program has to examine this text to determine
what it means in terms of the game logic (i.e., a call to the controller).
