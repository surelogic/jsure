This package manipulates the game model in a (nearly)
user-interface-agnostic manner.  The controller contains methods
such as &quot;travel&quot; and &quot;save&quot; that relate directly to
specific player commands.  These methods contain the &quot;business logic&quot;
of the game in the sense that they encode what the player commands actually do
to the game model.
