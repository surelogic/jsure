<body>
This package contains a simple, text-based
graphical user interface for SmallWorld that uses the Java
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/tsc/index.html">Swing</a> library.
The main program in this package is the <code>SmallWorld</code> class.
Currently SmallWorld has two user interfaces,
one textual and one (just barely) graphical.
