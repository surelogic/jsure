<p> This package includes the operator definitions for promise
nodes for the Java programming language.  They all descend from
<class>fluid.java.JavaPromiseOperator</class> which uses the locally
generated class <class>LoadPromises</class> to ensure all operators
are loaded when any operator is used.  It also includes a dictionary
mapping names to operator prototypes.</p>

<p> None of these operators are legal in the base Java syntax tree,
and only a few extend existing Java operators.  The various promise
operators are used to create small ASTs that
are attached to the plain Java AST with the ``promisedFor''
attribute.  See <class>fluid.java.JavaPromise</class> for specifics on
attaching and reattaching promises to ASTs.
</p>

<p> The following grammar is generated automatically from the operator
description files.  Nonterminals appearing on the left of a production
lead to the class definition when their links are followed.
Nonterminals on the right of a production lead to their definition in
the grammar.  The operator naming the actual operator stored with a
production is given after a hash sign (#).  Following this link goes
to the class documentation.</p>
