 * The variable components have special variable edges which are
 * connected up in parallel with the ones before and after.
 * These edges are then used to connect the actual subcomponent
 * for the child with the variable subcomponent around it.

   * connected with the first and last true
   * subcomponents in the sequence, whereas the inside is connected
   * to the outer context edges.  Perhaps it would be cleaner to have
   * two separate variable subcomponents, one without only output
   * edges and one with only input edges, but that would have complicated
   * matters.  As it stands when there are no children, the exit edges
   * connect immediately and in parallel with the entry edges.
