<p> This package implements Hoffman and O'Donnell's tree pattern matching
algorithm, with Chase's improvements.  The resulting mechanism of this
algorithm is a bottom-up (deterministic) tree automaton, which when
run on any valid tree will decide if that tree (or any of its
subtrees) is a representative of
any of the given patterns of interest.

<p>
The improvements include table compression so that to determine the
next state for a n-ary operator, we first map each of the states of
the children through a so-called ``mu'' map to get indices.  Then we take the
resulting indices and look up the result in the n-dimensional
``omega'' map.  See page 172 of [Chase87].
